Hi, my name is **Arseniy Kolmagorov** and I enjoy helping people and learning new things.

<span class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon"></span>
I currently work as a Data Engineer at Glovo in Barcelona, Spain. I really like to automate and improve data processes and alghouth that I currently work mainly on Data Engineering field, my background is very related to the Data Analytics. Before Data Engineering I worked as a Data Analyst at Glovo for 2 years.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in **Statistics** from University of Barcelona (UB) and Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). After, I decided to get some work experience to understand if I really wanted to work in data related field and fortunately it was a match! Right now, I'm  doing my Master's degree in **Data Science** at University of Barcelona (UB).

In terms of technical skils, I usually work with Python and PySpark as programming languages to build and maintain the ETL processes (AWS EMR) in Data Lake and Warehouse. I also used to work with R and JavaScript during my college period and just for fun. Also, have become proficient in SQL (postgreSQL, AWS Redshift) from handling data all day long. For visualization tool, I used to work with Looker and Data Studio. Summing up If I'm not familiar with some tool, I try to learn it as fast as I can throught googling, youtube and courses and usually it works :)
